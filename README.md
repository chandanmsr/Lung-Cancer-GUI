# Lung Cancer Prediction System (with GUI)
This project is a simple Lung Cancer Prediction System built using Python. It has a Tkinter-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) where users can input their details and check if they are at risk of lung cancer. The prediction result gets stored in a JSON file so that users can view their past results anytime in future.

## ✨ Features
Simple and clean GUI using Tkinter

Predicts lung cancer risk based on user inputs

Saves prediction results in a JSON file automatically

Easy to use and beginner friendly project

Future scope to improve with better models and more features

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

Tkinter (for GUI)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning model)

Pandas and NumPy (for data handling)

JSON (for result storage)

## 🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/chandanmsr/Lung-Cancer-GUI.git

Install the required libraries:

pip install requirements.txt

Run the project:

python main.py


## 🖥️ How it Works
User opens the app and fills the details like Age, Smoking habits, Anxiety, Chronic Diseases, etc.

After filling the form, the user clicks on Predict button.

The system predicts the risk (Yes or No) based on the trained ML model.

The prediction and user details are saved in a results.json file for future reference.

## 🎯 Objective
The aim of this project is to build a quick and easy system that helps predict lung cancer risk based on some health-related inputs. It is mainly designed to help in early detection and encourage users to seek medical advice if needed.

## 📈 Future Improvements
Use deep learning models to improve prediction

Add login/signup feature for multiple users

Create a better designed GUI using frameworks like PyQt or Kivy

Add an option to export the results to PDF or Excel
